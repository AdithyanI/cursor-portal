# MCP Server Hub

Welcome to the **MCP Server Hub** repository. This project is designed to serve as a single, unified backend driver for all your marketing and creative content needs, leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to seamlessly connect to various tools. Our goal is to reduce context switching and simplify automation across writing, publishing, and creative tasks.

## Overview

**Objective:**  
Build a modular, MCP-based server architecture that enables:
- **Centralized Content Creation:** Generate and refine text (in your voice) directly within your primary interface (Cursor).
- **Automated Publishing:** Seamlessly push content to multiple platforms such as LinkedIn, blog platforms (e.g., Ghost), and websites.
- **Enhanced Social Media Integration:** Publish to Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and more.
- **Creative Extensions (Stretch Goals):** Integrate image generation, video content generation, and script creation servers to enrich your content automatically.

**Why MCP?**  
- **Unified Interface:** One single driver for all tasks with minimal context switching.
- **Scalability:** Easily plug in new MCP servers as new tools or platforms emerge.
- **Automation:** Leverage AI capabilities to automate repetitive tasks (from content creation to publishing) and boost your marketing efforts.

## Goals & Use Cases

Within the next few days, our short-term goals are:
1. **Quick Start:** Get a basic MCP server up and running that can respond to simple content-generation requests (target: 30 seconds response time).
2. **Content Visibility:** Enable rapid publishing of content (LinkedIn posts, blog articles) to increase online presence.
3. **High-Impact Content:** Support the generation and publishing of high-quality, personalized content (e.g., CEO blog posts, thought leadership pieces).
4. **Creative Integration:** Experiment with integrating an image generation server (and later a video server) to auto-generate media assets that accompany your content.

```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/mcp-server-hub.git
   cd mcp-server-hub
   ```

2. **Installation:**
   - For Node.js-based servers:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - (Or follow language-specific setup instructions as documented in each server’s README.)

3. **Running a Server (Example: Blog Server):**
   ```bash
   cd servers/blog
   npm start
   ```
   This server will register itself with the existing MCP client.

4. **Configuration:**
   - Each server module has its own configuration file (e.g., `config.js`). Update these with your API keys, endpoints, and other integration details.

## Task Allocation & Developer Roles

To ensure rapid progress over the next couple of days, here’s an initial breakdown of tasks:

- **Adi:**  
  - Set up the base repository structure.
  - Prepare initial documentation (architecture.md and mcp-specs.md).
  - Oversee the integration of the Blog Posting Writer & Publisher server.
  - Initial commit & repo setup.

- **Developer 1:**  
  - Build and test the **Blog Server** module (integration with Ghost or preferred blogging platform).
  - Write unit tests and ensure 30-second response capability.

- **Developer 2:**  
  - Develop the **Social Servers**:
    - Twitter server integration.
    - LinkedIn server integration.
  - Begin work on Instagram server if time permits.

- **Developer 3:**  
  - Prototype the **Creative Modules**:
    - Start with a basic **Script Creation Server**.
    - Research requirements for the **Image Generation Server** (optional for initial release).

- **All Developers:**  
  - Contribute to the `docs/` directory with updates on architecture, integration challenges, and best practices.
  - Collaborate on the `tasks/task-allocation.md` file to update progress and reassign tasks as needed.

## Future Roadmap

- **Short-Term:**  
  - Launch the core MCP servers for blog and social media integrations.
  - Ensure seamless connectivity with the existing MCP client.

- **Mid-Term:**  
  - Expand creative modules (script creation, image, and video generation).
  - Integrate feedback from initial deployments (e.g., LinkedIn publishing effectiveness).

- **Long-Term:**  
  - Explore additional MCP server integrations (e.g., content analytics, SEO enhancements).
  - Refine automation to support a wider range of marketing and creative workflows.
