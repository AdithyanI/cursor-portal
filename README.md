1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cursor-portal.git
cd cursor-portal
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure your environment:
```bash
# Create .env files in respective directories:
# servers/blog/.env
GHOST_ADMIN_API_URL=your_ghost_url
GHOST_ADMIN_API_KEY=your_api_key
HEYGEN_API_KEY=your_heygen_api_key

# servers/creative/heygen-python-mcp/.env
HEYGEN_API_KEY=your_heygen_api_key
```

Add MCP servers in cursor settings using the command option:
path-to-venv path-to-server.py

### Basic Usage

Open composer in Cursor (cmd+l) and select Claude agent.

#### Writing a Blog Post
1. Start a conversation with Claude and mention you want to use the blog MCP:
```
"Hey, I'd like to write a blog post about [your topic]"
```

2. Claude will help you create the post using these commands:
```python
# Create a new draft
mcp_create_ghost_post(
    title="Your Amazing Title",
    html_content="<p>Your content with HTML formatting</p>",
    status="draft"
)

# Add images
mcp_add_image_to_post(
    post_id="your_post_id",
    image_url="https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg"
)

# Edit the post
mcp_edit_ghost_post(
    post_id="your_post_id",
    title="Updated Title",
    html_content="<p>Updated content</p>"
)

# When ready to publish
mcp_edit_ghost_post(
    post_id="your_post_id",
    status="published"
)
```

#### Creating and Adding Videos
1. Generate a video:
```python
# Generate the video
mcp_generate_video(
    script="Your video script here"
)
# Response will include a video_id

# Download the generated video
mcp_download_video(
    video_id="your_video_id"
)

# Upload to Ghost and add to post
mcp_upload_video_to_ghost(
    video_id="your_video_id"
)

# Add to your blog post
mcp_edit_ghost_post(
    post_id="your_post_id",
    video_id="your_video_id",
    video_position="top"  # or "bottom"
)
```

Example conversation flow:
```
You: "I want to create a blog post about my new coding project with a video intro"

Claude: "I'll help you create that. First, let's generate a video introduction..."
[Claude will guide you through the process using the commands above]
```
